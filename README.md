# Tesla-Pre-Owned-EV-Price-Prediction-Project

## Project Goals 

This project aims at analyzing the latest data regarding Tesla Pre-owned Electric Vehicle(EV) Prices in Canada and building machine learnning models that can predict prices of a pre-owned Tesla EV.

Data Obtained from : CarGurus, a Canada's Automotive Marketplace, through using web scraping.

Project Creator: Flora Yuen Ling Wong
